          <div class="news-content-head">PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets.</div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and
            sell
            crypto on its platform.</p>
          <div class="news-content-img"><img src="images/news-img1.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
            allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other
            wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature
            expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of
            Bitcoin </p>
          <p>BTC <span class="greencol">$16,704</span>, Ether ETH <span class="greencol">$1,217</span>, Bitcoin Cash BCH
            <span class="greencol">$100</span>, and Litecoin LTC <span class="greencol">$74.58</span>.
          </p>
          <p>Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to
            start
            transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the
            procedure.In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions
            of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of
            Financial
            Services for the conduct.</p>
          <p>Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
            blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the
            firm
            generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not
            charge
            fees for incoming transfers,</p>
          <p>The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank
            digital
            currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own
            stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin
            within the source code of the company's iPhone app. </p>

          <div class="news-content-head">Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those
            declaring crypto for tax purposes.</div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in
            2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.</p>
          <div class="news-content-img"><img src="images/news-img2.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before the
            end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and
            households facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.</p>
          <p>Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the
            implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a licensing
            frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc..
          </p>
          <p>The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an
            incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at
            14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.</p>
          <p>According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried
            forward.</p>
          <p>Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the
            document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions," doesn't
            constitute a "fiscal case." </p>

          <div class="news-content-head">Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to 132,500 BTC
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its most
            recent purchases. This year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as ‘the institutional-grade
            digital asset,’ said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.</p>
          <div class="news-content-img"><img src="images/news-img3.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate
            treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:</p>
          <p>Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500
            bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the
            2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.</p>
          <p>The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and
            Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more
            BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.</p>
          <p>The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began
            accumulating the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC.
            ‘Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from this transaction against previous
            capital gains, to the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in
            effect, which may generate a tax benefit,’ the SEC filing describes. </p>
          <p>Saylor said in an interview last week:<br>
            The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital asset and
            the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.
          </p>
          <p>The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading
            Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity.</p>
          <p>Saylor previously explained that Microstrategy is investing in BTC ‘for the long term.’ He added: ‘Our
            strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to
            go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.’</p>

          <div class="news-content-head">Bitcoin Miners’ Revenue Hits $9.55 Billion in 2022
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center;">2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency
            businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a series of catastrophic
            events, posed a threat to miners.</p>
          <div class="news-content-img"><img src="images/news-img4.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly losses, and soaring
            bitcoin hashrates that reached all-time highs. All these factors were affecting th H e profitability of the
            miners and were causing sell pressure.</p>
          <p>The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s, plummeted. Bitcoin, which was
            hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data collected
            from The Block, bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
          </p>
          <p><b>Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022 : </b><br>
            Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral alongside other
            cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major effect on the income and profits of miners.
            Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than
            that of 2021.
          </p>
          <p>Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue, according to the data from
            the block. This was actually considered to be a 206% year-over-year increase.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;">The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform.</p>
          <div class="news-content-img"><img src="images/news-img5.png" alt=""></div>
          <p>
            Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose ‘highly profitable trading strategy’ drained DeFi trading
            platform Mango Markets of crypto worth $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents
            said.
          </p>
          <p>The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the
            incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating
            a decentralized-finance trading platform.
          </p>
          <p>Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing unsealed
            Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.
          </p>
          <p>A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg ‘willfully and knowingly’
            manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.</p>
          <p>‘Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of
            perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and
            deceptive devices and contrivances.’</p>
